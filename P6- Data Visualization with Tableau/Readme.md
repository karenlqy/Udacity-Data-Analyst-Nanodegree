# Udacity DAND P6 Data Visualization with Tableau Write Up
### Qingyu Li  Aug. 23 2017  Project link is [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/qingyu.li#!/vizhome/AirTravelDelayStudy-DANDTableauClassProject/Story1?publish=yes)

## Background
I'm traveling out of Chicago O'Hare frequently and I am interested in studying the flight delay data for US in 2016. The data is downloaded from Bureau of Transportation Statistics website [RITA](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp) database. 

## Design
In this project, I'm interested to see which airport has highest average delay arrival in minutes and I would like to know the reason for such delay. I will find out the top 5 airports with arrival delays and study the delay time by security reason, weather and carrier.

- Card 1: A map of continental US of 48 states that plots the average arrival delay in minutes. The size of the dot indicates the length of the average delay. A dot in larger size indicates longer average arrival delay at a given airport.

- Card 2: A bar plot that shows the average arrival delay in minutes by airport. From this plot, we found out the top 5 airports that have longest average arrival delay.

- Card 3: Percentage of each delay category out of the arrival delay. Here we see that for each airport, carrier delay is count as the majority of the arrival delays. Chicago has the lowest percentage of delays due to carrier but delays due to weather is higher compare to other airports.

- Card 4: A map of continental US of 48 states with arrival delay by airlines.

## Design

- Card 1:  I would like to visually show the arrival delay for continental US. So I thought a map with circle size representing the delay time would be a good way to visually tell reader where are the most delays occur.

- Card 2: This card was not originally included in the story. But one of the feedback mentioned that there are gap between card 1 and card 2 so I added a card between these two and show a bar plot of the average arrival delay in minutes so that reader understands how I chose the five airports in card 3.

- Card 3: In this plot, there are five big columns for each airport. And then in each airport, I added the delay categories: weather, security, and carrier. I think in this design, we can not only compare across airports, but also compare the delay categories within each airport

- Card 4:
