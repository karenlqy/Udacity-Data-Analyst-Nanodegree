# Udacity DAND P6 Data Visualization with Tableau Write Up
### Qingyu Li  Aug. 23 2017 

## Background
I'm traveling out of Chicago O'Hare frequently and I am interested in studying the flight delay data for US in 2016. The data is downloaded from Bureau of Transportation Statistics website [RITA](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp) database. 

## Design
In this project, I'm interested to see which airport has highest average delay arrival in minutes and I would like to know the reason for such delay. I will find out the top 5 airports with arrival delays and study the delay time by security reason, weather and carrier.

- Card 1: A map of continental US of 48 states that plots the average arrival delay in minutes. The size of the dot indicates the length of the average delay. A dot in larger size indicates longer average arrival delay at a given airport.

- Card 2: A bar plot that shows the average arrival delay in minutes by airport. From this plot, we found out the top 5 airports that have longest average arrival delay.

- Card 3: Percentage of each delay category out of the arrival delay. Here we see that for each airport, carrier delay is count as the majority of the arrival delays. Chicago has the lowest percentage of delays due to carrier but delays due to weather is higher compare to other airports.

- Card 4: A map of continental US of 48 states with arrival delay by airlines.
